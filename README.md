# Move block entities!
Lets you pull and push chests, trapped chests, barrels, hoppers, all furnace types, lecterns, chiseled bookshelves, droppers, dispensers, jukeboxes, and even brewing stands with pistons!
Like how you can push Tile Entities/Block Entities like chests with pistons on bedrock, definitely a good addon for geyser to have cross-platform Redstone.

Please feel free to report any bugs at the github link, and ideas/wants in the reviews! (Or if I should rename to MovableBlockEntities)

Move block entities without moving things like obsidian or enchanting tables.
Block entities cannot move when powered.
